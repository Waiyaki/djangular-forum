# djangular-forum
A simple forum web application.

Recreation of django by example forum using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),
[DRF](https://www.djangoproject.com), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Angular Material](material.angularjs.org/latest/), 
following practices gained from [thinkster.io's django + angular tutorial](https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial/).

This is a work in progress, it's largely incomplete.

The project is not at all optimised for mobile.

See a demo in this project's [website](https://mfdrf.herokuapp.com/).


The name **Marioshoni** used as the forum's name comes from the novel *[The River Between](http://www.amazon.com/River-Between-African-Writers-Series/dp/0435905481)* by
**[Ngugi wa Thiong'o](http://www.ngugiwathiongo.com/)**, and so does the nickname *Waiyaki*.
